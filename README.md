# Pig Game

Pig Game is small game where you can compete with anyone by rolling a die.

The rules are simple:

- roll the die and earn points;
- beware of the number 1 â€“ it will reset your current score and pass the turn to the next player;
- press the hold button to save your accumulated points and pass the move to the next player;
- the player who scores 100 points wins.
